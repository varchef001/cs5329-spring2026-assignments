# Lab 2.1 – Recurrence Experimentation and Analysis

**Course:** CS 5329 – Algorithm Design and Analysis  
**Student Name:** Varshith Gandra  
**Semester:** Spring 2026

## Overview
This lab compares a naive recursive Fibonacci implementation with a dynamic programming
(memoized) implementation. The goal is to observe how runtime changes as input size grows
and explain the performance difference using Big-O notation and recurrence intuition.

## How to Run the Code
From the repository root folder, run:

```bash
python Lab2.1/assignment2_fibonacci.py
